    "content": "<div>I'm an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). In the realm of CS, I am interested in competitive programming, web development, systems architecture, and machine learning.\n\nI'm also passionate about addressing widespread social and ethical issues we face today as a result of technological proliferation. Besides that, I am often learning new technologies or languages. Most recently, I acquainted myself with React and Gatsby. I am currently exploring server-side systems, system architecture and design patterns and their integration with full-stack web development.\n\nOutside of tech, I like cooking, reading (mostly non-fiction), playing Jenga, long drives, watching superhero movies, and running.\n\nI also like meeting new people and getting to know their ideas, and perspectives, this allows me to be a better team member and an efficient and collaborative problem solver.\n\nI hope that my words shed light on what I do and who I am as a person. To know more, you can view my projects below or read my blog. To know more about me professionaly, you can connect with me on LinkedIn, or view my work experience below.</div>",
