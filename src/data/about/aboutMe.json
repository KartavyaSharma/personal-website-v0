    "content": "<div>I'm an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). In the realm of CS, I am interested in competitive programming, web development, systems architecture, and machine learning.\n\nI'm also passionate about solving some of the widespread social and ethical issues we face today as a result of extensive technological proliferation; an example of such would be ROZE &#8212; a project I worked on during high school. Besides that, I am often learning new technologies or languages. Most recently, I acquainted myself with React and Gatsby. I am currently exploring backend development and system architecture to expand my suite of skills and technologies.\n\nOutside of tech, I like cooking, reading, watching any superhero movie I can get my hands on, and running (albeit seldom).\n\nI also like meeting new people and getting to know their ideas, perspectives, and backgrounds on a host of topics and disciplines; this allows me to be a better team member and an efficient and collaborative problem solver.\n\nI hope that my words shed light on what I do and who I am as a person. To know more, you can view my projects below or read my blog &#8212; a notepad of sorts where I write about my tech-related musings.</div>",
