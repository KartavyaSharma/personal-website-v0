        "about": "Salkatech is a global satellite and telecom integration company based in Noida, India. I made their website as part of a contract with the company.<br/><br/>The website's core consists mostly of HTML and CSS with Bootstrap. I used JQuery to enable certain run-time functionality, such as navbar scroll detection and mobile menus. The website consists of static product pages with options to inquire about said products. To elaborate on the company's services and its previous projects, I created individual project pages that contained carousels and project descriptions. I also made use of Google Maps APIs to embed a static geolocation frame in the footer.<br/><br/>Salkatech's goal with this website was to create a public-facing online presence, and a static site was an ideal solution. Since the website has minimal dynamic content, its load times are relatively faster, and the website uses minimal client-side processing, ensuring a smoother overall browsing experience.",

The current iteration of it makes use of many technologies such as GraphQL, Formik, and Forestry CMS, to name a few (you can find the complete list below).<br /><br />The contact form is managed by Web3Forms, and all validation is handled by Formik (a frontend form library for React).<br /><br />In addition to forms, all blog posts are integrated within the website, and each post has a dedicated comments section based on Github's issue interface. Moreover, all posts have an SEO component which enables sharing across multiple platforms. Each project (similar to this one) has a dedicated page generated through a template.<br /><br />If you feel the website could use some upgrades, feel free to reach out to me using my email or the contact form.<br /><br />If you wish to know more about how I built this website, stick around; I will be writing posts outlining how to code each component once a week.</div>",
