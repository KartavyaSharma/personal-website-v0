# Bellevue in 2008

My fondest memories of Bellevue, a suburb east of Seattle, include going for bike rides at the local park and short treks on nearby trails. This was 2008. Bellevue was full of lush streets and open spaces. There were less people around and the traffic wasn't so bad. Housing wasn't a big problem either. One could easily find a two bedroom for under $1000/month. That has all changed in the last 14 years.

This blog post essentially takes a look at Seattle, its suburbs and their evolution over the years with the added context of Anzia Yezierska's "How I found America".

# The Context

Anzia Yezierska's How I Found America details her life immigrating to America, the disillusionment fromt the promise of the American Dream. What I want to focus on is the city, its anatomy, and the impact it had on Anzia when she first moved there, and then I will compare how Bellevue has more or less transformed, or transforming, in recent years, into the lifeless concrete jungle that Anzia described in the first few pages of "How I Found America".

Before Anzia immigrated to America, she imagined it to be the oasis where the it was sunny always, there were plenty of green spaces, and her apartment would give her the best views of Manhattan. She imagined the world would be her osyter, she could do whatever she wanted. Instead, what she found was in some ways literally the opposit of what she had envisioned. The drab weather, closed off apartments, soaring rents, and a constant stuggle to stay on top of bills and afford housing.

# How They Compare

My memories of Bellevue center around characteristics of New York that were unappealing to Yezierska. Open spaces, relativly affordable housing, appartments with light. But in recent years, all of that has changed. In the past 14 years, there has been a huge influx of people from neighboring states, as well as from the rest of the world, into Seattle and Bellevue. Primarily driven by large companies, such as Amazon and Microsoft. Apartments that went for $600/month go for upwards of two grand nowerdays, much more than standard year-on-year inflation.

Walking acorss Bellevue isn't the same either, while compared to New York there are still more parks and open spaces, but since 2008 these have significantly been reduced. Apartment complexs are the new normal now with towering buildings packed into rigid urban plans. While I support more housing to accomodate for the influx of population, I feel the city should take into account how they allocate space for such housing projects. Instead of concentrating housing in a single neighborhood or sector, a good alternative could be to expand outward from the suburb.

Nevertheless, people are increasingly finding it harder to get housing and people who are earning low wages are paying for it. Downtown Seattle, and to some extent even Bellevue, have become unaffordable regions.

# Too Many People?

Recently, I've also realized that people around Seattle have a reputation of being unfriendly, aloof, or introverted. While this might be true a decage ago, it seems like a more prevalent opinion these days. Anzia's description of New York and its underlying tone where "savages who had to eat one another alive in order to survive" (Yezierska, 117), is in essense what Seattle and its suburbs are becoming. Perhaps less sever than New York, the averge-worder has to work long minimum-wage shifts in order to make rent and other living expenses. This influx of people leading the residents to be more separated from one another, caring more about themselves, and how to one up someone else to climb the economic ladder.

These are some of the examples of how Bellevue, Seattle, and other surrounding suburbs have changed over the years, and the subtle similarities they carry in relation to Anzia Yezierska's "How I Found America" and the portrayal of New York as a urban jungle.
