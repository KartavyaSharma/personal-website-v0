# Bellevue in 2008

My fondest memories of Bellevue, a suburb east of Seattle, included going for bike rides at the local park and short treks on nearby trails. This was 2008. Bellevue was full of lush streets and open spaces. There were fewer people around and the traffic wasn't so bad. Housing wasn't a big problem either. One could easily find a two-bedroom for under $1000/month. That has all changed in the last 14 years.

This blog post essentially takes a look at Seattle, its suburbs, and their evolution over the years with the added context of Anzia Yezierska's "How I found America".

# The Context

Anzia Yezierska's How I Found America details her life immigrating to America, and the disillusionment from the promise of the American Dream. What I want to focus on is the city, its anatomy, and the impact it had on Anzia when she first moved there, and then I will compare how Bellevue has more or less transformed, in recent years, into the lifeless concrete jungle that Anzia described in the first few pages of "How I Found America".

Before Anzia immigrated to America, she imagined it to be an oasis where it was sunny always, there were plenty of green spaces, and her apartment would give her the best views of Manhattan. She imagined the world would be her oyster, she could do whatever she wanted. Instead, what she found was in some ways the opposite of what she had envisioned. The drab weather, closed-off apartments, soaring rents, and a constant struggle to stay on top of bills and find affordable housing.

# How They Compare

My memories of Bellevue center around characteristics of New York that were unappealing to Yezierska. Open spaces, relatively affordable housing, and apartments with light. But in recent years, all of that has changed. In the past 14 years, there has been a huge influx of people from neighboring states, as well as from the rest of the world, into Seattle and Bellevue. Primarily driven by large companies, such as Amazon and Microsoft. Apartments that went for $600/month go for upwards of two grand nowadays, much more than standard year-on-year inflation.

Walking across Bellevue isn't the same either, while compared to New York there are still more parks and open spaces, but since 2008 these have significantly been reduced. Apartment complexes are the new normal now with towering buildings packed into rigid urban plans. While I support more housing to accommodate the influx of population, I feel the city should take into account how they allocate space for such housing projects. Instead of concentrating on housing in a single neighborhood or sector, a good alternative could be to expand outward from the suburb.

Nevertheless, people are increasingly finding it harder to get housing, and people who are earning low wages are paying for it. Downtown Seattle, and to some extent even Bellevue, have become unaffordable regions.

# Too Many People?

Recently, I've also realized that people around Seattle have a reputation for being unfriendly, aloof, or introverted. While this might be true a decade ago, it seems like a more prevalent opinion these days. Anzia's description of New York and its underlying tone where "savages who had to eat one another alive in order to survive" (Yezierska, 117), is in essence what Seattle and its suburbs are becoming. Perhaps less severe than in New York, the average worker has to work long minimum-wage shifts to make rent and other living expenses. This influx of people led the residents to be more separated from one another, caring more about themselves, and how to one-up someone else to climb the economic ladder.

These are some of the examples of how Bellevue, Seattle, and other surrounding suburbs have changed over the years, and the subtle similarities they carry with Anzia Yezierska's "How I Found America" and the portrayal of New York as an urban jungle.
