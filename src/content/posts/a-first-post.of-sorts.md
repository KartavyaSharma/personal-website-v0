# Welcome

This being my first post, I'll mostly talk about why and how I started this blog, and what you can expect as a reader going forward.

In its essence, this is, quite simply put, a blog. It will act as a canvas (or a notepad, for the lack of a better word) for my ideas, and the occasional step-by-step. I won't restrict myself to a particular domain of topics just yet; however, you will find a slightly ambiguous categorization of the topics/posts I plan on writing about.

### Why?

Throughout this website and blog's development process, I kept returning to a question: "Why exactly am I starting a blog?" I wouldn't call myself an avid writer. Moreover, it took me more than half an hour to write up to this point. What reason could there possibly be for me to develop a personal blogging website? The reason, although somewhat unorthodox, was to "develop".

There is a sea of blog-starter options to choose from out there. Most options provide one-size-fits-all solutions for blogs that get you started right out of the box. However, starting a blog was more of a peripheral purpose behind this project. My primary goal was to build a somewhat large web development project. This website + blog gave me a good opportunity to build something while getting a primer of core/mainstream web development technologies.

Now, I realize that to a reader my previous statement might sound appalling. Why start a blog at all if writing isn't your main goal? Fortunately, there's more to this blog than that.
