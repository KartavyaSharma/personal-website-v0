title: Setting up your competitive programming environment using Cygwin
description: There are a number of ways you can setup your competitive programming
  environment. In this post I'll mostly be focusing on using Cygwin with GVIM/VIM/Notepad++
  setups along with CPP templates that can help speed up your initial setup process
  during a competition.

# Getting started

If you haven't already, you will need to install a couple of things before you can start the actual setup process.

You can install Cygwin from [this]() link.

If you don't have CPP build tools installed, you can choose from a number of options, including [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) and [mingw-w64](http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download)
