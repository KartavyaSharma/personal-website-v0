## &#x26a0;&#xfe0f; **This project has been deprecated!**
This web app has several outdated/deprecated dependencies from the Gatsby plugin ecosystem. A lot of other plugins/dependencies have introduced breaking changes that require significant changes in my codebase to successfully build this project. As of now, I don't plan on deploying any new builds as they aren't compatible with new plugin versions.

Be on the lookout for v1 of my personal website which will use Bun and SvelteKit. This website will remain online while I setup the new version, and eventually it will move over to [v0.kartavyas.com](https://v0.kartavyas.com/).
